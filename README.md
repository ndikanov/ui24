### How to use

1. Copy the script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndikanov/ui24/master/custom.min.js).
1. Open the Mixer Interface in a browser.
1. Open a console by pressing:
    * `Ctrl + Shift + J` on Windows and Linux,
    * `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac
2. Paste the script to the console and press `Enter`.
1. Close the console.

You may get an error in a console:

>Error saving setting with name: consoleHistory, value length: 5448306. Error: Failed to set the 'consoleHistory' property on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'consoleHistory' exceeded the quota.

Don't worry. It does not affect the script execution.

Script works until page reload.
